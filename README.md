# Huffma_coding
Developed a file compressor using Huffman coding, enhancing file storage efficiency through optimal data encoding. The project involved:

-Constructing a Huffman tree to prioritize frequently occurring data.
-Encoding data based on frequency to achieve significant file size reduction.
-Implementing the algorithm in C++ to ensure fast and efficient compression.
This project demonstrated proficiency in algorithm design, data structures, and optimization techniques,
contributing to a deeper understanding of data compression and its practical applications in software development.
The successful implementation of the file compressor showcases problem-solving skills and the ability to apply theoretical concepts to real-world scenarios.
